/**
 * Joint definitions are used to construct joints.
 *
 * <p>
 * Each joint type has a definition that derives from {@link JointDef}. All
 * joints are connected between two different bodies. One body may static.
 * Joints between static and/or kinematic bodies are allowed, but have no effect
 * and use some processing time.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * You can specify user data for any joint type and you can provide a flag to
 * prevent the attached bodies from colliding with each other. This is actually
 * the default behavior and you must set the {@link JointDef#collideConnected}
 * Boolean to allow collision between to connected bodies.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Many joint definitions require that you provide some geometric data. Often a
 * joint will be defined by anchor points. These are points fixed in the
 * attached bodies. jbox2d requires these points to be specified in local
 * coordinates. This way the joint can be specified even when the current body
 * transforms violate the joint constraint - a common occurrence when a game is
 * saved and reloaded. Additionally, some joint definitions need to know the
 * default relative angle between the bodies. This is necessary to constrain
 * rotation correctly.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Initializing the geometric data can be tedious, so many joints have
 * initialization functions that use the current body transforms to remove much
 * of the work. However, these initialization functions should usually only be
 * used for prototyping. Production code should define the geometry directly.
 * This will make joint behavior more robust.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The rest of the joint definition data depends on the joint type.
