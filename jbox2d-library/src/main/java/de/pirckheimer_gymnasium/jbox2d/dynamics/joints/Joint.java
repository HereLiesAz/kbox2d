/**
 * The base joint class. Joints are used to constrain two bodies together in
 * various fashions. Some joints also feature limits and motors.
 *
 * <p>
 * Joints are used to constrain bodies to the world or to each other. Typical
 * examples in games include ragdolls, teeters, and pulleys. Joints can be
 * combined in many different ways to create interesting motions.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Some joints provide limits so you can control the range of motion. Some joint
 * provide motors which can be used to drive the joint at a prescribed speed
 * until a prescribed force/torque is exceeded.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Joint motors can be used in many ways. You can use motors to control position
 * by specifying a joint velocity that is proportional to the difference between
 * the actual and desired position. You can also use motors to simulate joint
 * friction: set the joint velocity to zero and provide a small, but significant
 * maximum motor force/torque. Then the motor will attempt to keep the joint
 * from moving until the load becomes too strong.
