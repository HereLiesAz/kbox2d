/**
 * <p>
 * The Dynamics module is the most complex part of jbox2d and is the part you
 * likely interact with the most. The Dynamics module sits on top of the Common
 * and Collision modules, so you should be somewhat familiar with those by now.
 * </p>
 *
 * The Dynamics module contains:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>fixture class</li>
 * <li>rigid body class</li>
 * <li>contact class</li>
 * <li>joint classes</li>
 * <li>world class</li>
 * <li>listener classes</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * There are many dependencies between these classes so it is difficult to
 * describe one class without referring to another. In the following, you may
 * see some references to classes that have not been described yet. Therefore,
 * you may want to quickly skim this chapter before reading it closely.
 * </p>
