# [KPhysics](https://kphysics.github.io/KPhysics/)
KPhysics is an improved and extended version of Hayden Marshall's JPhysics. It is a 2D physics engine with zero third-party dependencies.

It is written in Kotlin and is intended to be easily used in games programmed with Kotlin or Java.

## Tech Demos

A tech demo can be found [here](https://github.com/Chafficui/KPhysicsDemos) and includes various examples to show what the engine is capable of.
To run the demos yourself simply clone the KPhysicsDemo repository and run the Main.java file.

## Using KPhysics

### Prerequisites
- An appropriate IDE for example Intellij (with java 1.8+ JDK installed)
- Maven/Gradle or other dependency manager

### Add KPhysics to your project
Add KPhysics to your classpath by adding a Maven/Gradle dependency from [Jitpack](https://jitpack.io/#Chafficui/KPhysics).

#### Maven
```xml
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>jitpack.io</id>
    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
```

````xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.Chafficui</groupId>
    <artifactId>KPhysics</artifactId>
    <version>Tag</version>
  </dependency>
</dependency>
````

#### Gradle
```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.Chafficui:KPhysics:Tag'
}
```

### Get Started
#### Create your world
The world is an instance that exerts physical forces on all objects contained within it. It can be given a gravity vector, such as (0, -9.81). If this is not done, there is no gravity in the world.
````kotlin
val world = World(Vec(.0, -9.81))
````

#### Create bodies
The next step is to create bodies. These are objects on which forces act, such as the player, or the ground, or even a bouncy ball (like it is in our example).
````kotlin
val bouncyBall = Body(Circle(20.0), .0, 200.0)
````
A Body takes a shape (Polygon or Circle) and the position with x and y coordinates. We can also change some aspects of it, like the density, the drag and also the restitution (what we will do).
````kotlin
bouncyBall.restitution =1.0
````
We will also add a plattform, where we set the density to zero, so that it does not move if the bouncy ball touches it.
````kotlin
val plattform = Body(Polygon(600.0, 20.0), .0, -300.0)
plattform.setDensity(.0)
````
The last thing we need to add in this step is the bodies to the world. We do this as follows.
````kotlin
world.addBody(bouncyBall)
world.addBody(plattform)
````

#### Run the world
In your game loop or update method you should now run the world steps.
````kotlin
world.step(deltaTime)
````
This takes the time passed between the last step and now.

#### What's next?
KPhysics is very feature rich. For example, there is RayTracing, particle physics and explosion physics. To learn more about these things, it is worth taking a look at our dokka, or the javascripts.

## Documentation
Full documentation is available, including a comprehensive API reference and a getting started guide.

- **[API Reference](docs/dokka/index.html)**: A complete API reference generated by Dokka.
- **[Getting Started Guide](docs/guide.md)**: A guide to help you get started with KPhysics, with examples and explanations.
