# Agent Instructions for KPhysics Documentation

This document provides instructions for AI agents on how to maintain the documentation for the KPhysics library.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation for this project consists of three main parts:

1.  **KDocs in the Source Code**: The primary source of documentation is the KDoc comments in the Kotlin source files (`.kt`). These comments are used to generate the API reference.
2.  **Generated API Reference**: The HTML API reference is generated by Dokka and is located in the `docs/dokka` directory. The main entry point is `docs/index.html`.
3.  **Getting Started Guide**: A handwritten guide for new users, located at `docs/guide.md`.

## Maintaining the Documentation

### 1. Updating the API Reference

To update the API reference, you must first update the KDoc comments in the source code.

- **All public classes, methods, and properties should have descriptive KDocs.**
- Use `@param`, `@return`, `@property`, and `@see` tags where appropriate.
- Include code examples in the class-level KDocs to demonstrate usage.

After updating the KDocs, you must regenerate the HTML documentation by running the following command in the root of the repository:

```bash
mvn dokka:dokka
```

This will update the files in the `docs/` directory.

### 2. Updating the Getting Started Guide

The Getting Started Guide (`docs/guide.md`) should be kept in sync with any major changes to the library's API or features.

- If you add a new major feature, consider adding a section to the guide to explain how to use it.
- If you make a breaking change, ensure that the examples in the guide are updated accordingly.

### 3. General Workflow

1.  Make your changes to the source code (adding features, fixing bugs, etc.).
2.  Update the KDoc comments to reflect your changes.
3.  If necessary, update the `docs/guide.md` file.
4.  Regenerate the documentation using `mvn dokka:dokka`.
5.  Verify that the generated documentation in `docs/` is correct.
6.  Commit all your changes, including the updated documentation.
