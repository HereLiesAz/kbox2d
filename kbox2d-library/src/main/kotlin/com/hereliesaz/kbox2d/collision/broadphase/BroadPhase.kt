/**
 * The broad-phase is used for computing pairs and performing volume queries and
 * ray casts. This broad-phase does not persist pairs. Instead, this reports
 * potentially new pairs. It is up to the client to consume the new pairs and to
 * track subsequent overlap.
 *
 *
 *
 * Collision processing in a physics step can be divided into narrow-phase and
 * broad-phase. In the narrow-phase we compute contact points between pairs of
 * shapes. Imagine we have N shapes. Using brute force, we would need to perform
 * the narrow-phase for N*N/2 pairs.
 *
 *
 *
 * The b2BroadPhase class reduces this load by using a dynamic tree for pair
 * management. This greatly reduces the number of narrow-phase calls.
 *
 *
 *
 * Normally you do not interact with the broad-phase directly. Instead, Box2D
 * creates and manages a broad-phase internally. Also, b2BroadPhase is designed
 * with Box2D's simulation loop in mind, so it is likely not suited for other
 * use cases.
