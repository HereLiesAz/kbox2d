/**
 * A manifold point is a contact point belonging to a contact manifold. It holds
 * details related to the geometry and dynamics of the contact points. The local
 * point usage depends on the manifold type:
 *
 *  * circles: the local center of circleB
 *  * faceA: the local center of circleB or the clip point of polygonB
 *  * faceB: the clip point of polygonA
 *
 * This structure is stored across time steps, so we keep it small.<br></br>
 * Note: the impulses are used for internal caching and may not provide reliable
 * contact forces, especially for high speed collisions.
